# Bermy.xyz - Bermuda bus and ferry schedules

This was built out of the desire of creating something a built more functional
than having to rely on browsing to each of these respective pages:

* Bus schedules - https://www.gov.bm/bus-routes-and-maps
* Ferry Schedules - http://www.marineandports.bm/ferries_about.aspx

These URLs are difficult to remember and provide a poor mobile experience.

Bermy.xyz is easy to remember and friendly for mobile commuters.

### Ideas

* Schedules in accordance to
  [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/)
* Rethink how to display bus routes 1, 3, 7 and 8
* Routes based on time and location. Display availability and in correct
  direction. Incorporate average bus times.
* Interactive map of bus and ferry routes

### Other Ideas

* Weather Information
* Mobile apps built with React Native
