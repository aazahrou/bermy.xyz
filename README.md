# Bermy.xyz - Bermuda Bus and Ferry Schedules

This was built out of the desire of creating something a built more functional than having to rely on browsing to each of these respective pages:

- Bus schedules - https://www.gov.bm/bus-routes-and-maps
- Ferry Schedules - http://www.marineandports.bm/ferries_about.aspx

These URLs are difficult to remember and provide a poor mobile experience.

Bermy.xyz is easy to remember and friendly for mobile commuters.

### Ideas

- Progressive Web App
- Schedules in accordance to General Transit Feed Specification
- Rethink how to display bus routes 1, 3, 7 and 8
- Routes based on time and location. Display availability and in correct direction.
